<h1> Reason for Irrelevant and Relevant Topics </h1>
      <p> There are two list of debatable topics, irrelevant and relevant. We created this because with irrelevant topics
       it's fun to debate about topics that really have no meaning what so ever. For example, Coffee vs. Tea it's 
      not important to the world but what's the harm in talking about our preferences what it comes to morning/hot 
      beverages.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Relevant topics are very fundamental because it helps people have an understanding of the world. For they can know 
      what's going on around them that they are able to have conversations with people from places across the world about 
      political/world problems. Also, they can formulate opinions of their own and no one can influence the knowledge they 
      have obtain through reading our post since we aren't a biased website.</p>

              <li>Instagram vs. Snapchat</li>
              <p> We chose these topics because if you see instagram and snapchat, Instagram are starting to take certain elements that 
          Snapchat, for example, the instagram stories. So, because of that we want to see people's opinions on this new change
         for instagram. Which app do they prefer? Like, are they going to give up Snapchat ot is it going to be the other way 
         around? </p>
              <li> pancakes vs. waffles</li>
              <p>  I love breakfast and everyone else does(at least I hope they do) but anyways the point some people when they wake up
              in the morning they like to eat pancakes or waffles. So, which one do you think is better? Because if I wanted to, my fatass 
              would eat both but you guys probably wouldn't. 
              <li>Are aliens real?</li>
              <p> We would never know the answer so what's better just have people argue about there's no actually evidence to prove this 
              this fact.
              <li>Morning Showers vs. Night Showers</li>
              <p> Well, it's fun to hear about people's hygienic ways of life. Like, I personally take two showers both morning and night
              but everyone is different.
              <li>Aubrih real or nah?</li>
              <p> They need to stop playing us and officially come out as a COUPLE?!?! LIKE THEY ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER, what's the harm in 
              claiming each other.
              <li>Coffee vs. Tea</li>
              <p> What's your favorite hot beverage? Please tell us we really want to know.
              <li>Vegans vs Vegetarians</li>
              <p> A lot of people are changing their eating habits but is it for better or worse? So, if you are vegetarian or vegan 
              tells why you chose this lifestyle and if you not please argue it would mean soooo much I'm telling you like literally. </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <li> Cultural Appropriation</li>
              <p> This is a huge topic that is uprising due to the Kardashians taking certain things from other cultures like cornrows and calling it boxer braids
              instead of giving credit to the cultures.</p>
              <li>Gun control</li>
              <p> With all the gun violence going on with the police officers killing black people, i think it's great topic for people to put their opinion to keep 
              up with current events.</p>
              <li>Abortion</li>
              <p> All of people are very sensitive when it comes to this topic, so we hope that our site can provide a place where people can be comfortable in 
              expressing their opinions about this.</p>
              <li>Gender-Neutral bathrooms</li>
              <p> The same thing as abortion, this is a very sensitive topic but since there was a law passed that transgenders can use any bathroom they feel
              comfortable. So, what do you guys think of this decision?</p>
              <li>Climate Change</li>
              <p> Well the environment is such a huge issue especially global warming what wouldn't want people want to debate on this.</p>
              <li>Education</li>
              <p> Do you think you are receiving a high quality beneficial at you school? Do you think education is important, if not tells why not for people can definitely
              "fight" you.</p>
              <li>Taxes</li>
              <p> What do you think, should people pay higher taxes or low taxes? Who should get taxed the most rich ot the middle class? Please tell us your opinion we
               really want to know. </p>
              <li>Immigration</li>
              <p> With all the Donald Trump antics going on, I want to know what your guys' opinion on his views of immigrants.</p>
              <li>Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton</li>
              <p> The presidential debate is coming up what's your opinion on it.</p>
